## Content
As part of the module "Online Presence & MarTech Stack" we were given the task, to come up with an online marketing strategy for the fictive Company "Chillomania", that is selling uniquely patterned, sustainable couches. 
The project contained:
* mapping the customer journey for two Customer Persona "Olaf" and "Jennifer"
* giving recommendations for Chillomania's Online Presence, based on that mapping
* recommendations for which MarTech to use in Chillomania's day-to-day work


Results can be seen in the presentation, that was given as a submission of the results.
